With rest APIs, we create classes inheriting from the Resource class. These are our endpoints you can access. Depending on the type
of request that the user sends, we create methods reflecting those requests, and choose to add JWT auth requirements to them.

Use Model classes to create objects that can be passed into databases via Resource classes (save_to_db)
